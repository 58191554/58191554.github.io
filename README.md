I am Zhen Tong, Computer Science undergraduate students in Chinese University of Hong Kong ShenZhen. I am interested in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. I am supervised by [Prof.Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/) and doing research about RL in Combinatorial Problems. I have done data analysis work in FoShan Siemens and now I am looking for intership about algorithm design and implementation.
